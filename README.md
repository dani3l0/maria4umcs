# maria4umcs

Mobile friendly, dark-themed version of [moria.umcs.lublin.pl](http://moria.umcs.lublin.pl/) timetable for UMCS students.


## Why

[moria.umcs.lublin.pl](http://moria.umcs.lublin.pl/) in terms of design, sucks at any screen.
It's hard to read and sometimes even impossible to check lesson's details (especially on mobile devices).

I created **Maria** to make my life easier and check the timetable faster with less chance for misreadings.

Why **Maria**? Well, I think there is a typo in **moria** word, and UMCS's patron is **Maria** Sk≈Çodowska-Curie, so I fixed that...


## Features
- Just checking the timetable, nothing else lol


## Project state

And this will probably never change :~|

**Code still needs many cleanups and optimizations, as well as important bug fixes.**

_It just works_


## Contribution

Feel free to open issues, create pull requests or even PM'ing me. That's an open sauce project, do whatever you want with it.
